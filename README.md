The chrome extension for time tracking and productivity analysis is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The extension has a popup window (popup.html) where users can see their tracked time and website data. The background script (background.js) runs in the browser and keeps track of active tabs(chatgpt/youtube/whatsapp), user activity(gaming/chats), and idle time. Permissions like tabs, storage, and idle allow the extension to get information about open tabs, save data locally, detect when the user is inactive(neutral), and run checks at scheduled times.The Time Tracker & Productivity Chrome extension helps users track how much time they spend on different websites and whether the websites are productive(useful for us) or unproductive(not useful). The host permission (all urls used) lets the tracker supervise any website the user visits. This project shows how Chrome extensions can monitor browsing, store data, and give productivity feedback.
